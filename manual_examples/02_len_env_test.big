# Verifying explicit counting via environment library

# 1. Load the environment
attach len

# 2. Test Lists
MyList = "[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]"
run LenList($MyList) & set as {ListSize}
print "List has $ListSize items."

# 3. Test Maps
MyMap = "{\"id\": 1, \"status\": \"ok\", \"verified\": true}"
run LenMap($MyMap) & set as {MapSize}
print "Map has $MapSize keys."

# 4. Standard len still works for characters
Name = "BigC"
CharLen = len$Name
print "Standard len of '$Name' is $CharLen characters."
