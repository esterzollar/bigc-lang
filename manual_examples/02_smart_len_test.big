# 1. Literal Mode (Measure the word itself)
L1 = len Name
print "Literal 'Name' length: $L1"  # Should be 4

# 2. Data Mode (Measure the content)
Name = "Ester"
L2 = len$Name
print "Data inside $Name: $L2"     # Should be 5

# 3. Backpack Mode (Count items)
MyList = "[\"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Cherry\"]"
L3 = len$MyList
print "Items in Backpack: $L3"      # Should be 3 (not character count!)

# 4. Vault Mode (Count keys)
MyMap = "{\"id\": 1, \"status\": \"ok\"}"
L4 = len$MyMap
print "Keys in Map: $L4"            # Should be 2

# 5. Math Lab Integration
Math = S[len$MyList + 10]
print "Math (3 + 10): $Math"        # Should be 13
